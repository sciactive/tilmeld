    <h2>Tilmeld Instructions</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Some help for setting up this awesome user system.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Welcome to Tilmeld. This program handles users and groups. It can be a
    little tricky to set up, so read through these instructions carefully.
  </p>
  <div class="my-3 border border-top-0 border-right-0 border-left-0">
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Tilmeld uses Nymph entities to store users and groups. It allows users to
    register and log in using the Nymph REST endpoint.
  </p>
  <div class="my-3 border border-top-0 border-right-0 border-left-0">
    <h3>Users</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    User accounts can be created either in this setup app or by using the
    TilmeldLogin component to register. The first user account registered in
    Tilmeld will be granted admin priveleges with the <code>system/admin</code>
    ability.
  </p>
  <div class="my-3 border border-top-0 border-right-0 border-left-0">
    <h3>Primary Groups</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Users can have only one primary group. It becomes the group of any entities
    they create. By default, Tilmeld will create a new primary group for every
    user.
  </p>
  <div class="my-3 border border-top-0 border-right-0 border-left-0">
    <h3>Secondary Groups</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Secondary groups are used to grant users additional abilities or give access
    to entities.
  </p>
  <div class="my-3 border border-top-0 border-right-0 border-left-0">
    <h3>Access Controls</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Tilmeld filters all calls to Nymph to allow users to only see and modify the
    entities they have access to. When a user creates an entity, their user
    becomes the <code>user</code> property of that entity, and their primary
    group becomes the <code>group</code> property. By default, entites will
    allow read/write/delete access to their user, read access to their group,
    and no access to other users.
  </p>
  <div class="my-3 border border-top-0 border-right-0 border-left-0">
    <h3>Abilities</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Abilities can be granted to users and/or their groups. When you call
    <code>gatekeeper</code>, it will check for the given ability.
  </p>
  <div class="my-3 border border-top-0 border-right-0 border-left-0">
    <h3>Generated Primary Groups</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Tilmeld, by default, is configured to generate a primary group for every new
    user. When the user is changed, that information is propagated to the group.
  </p>
</div>

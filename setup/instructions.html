</div>
<div>
  Welcome to Tilmeld. This program handles users and groups. It can be a
  little tricky to set up, so read through these instructions carefully.

<div class="page-header">
  <h3>How It Works</h3>
</div>
<div>
  Tilmeld uses Nymph entities to store users and groups. It allows users to register and log in using the Nymph REST endpoint.
</div>
<div class="page-header">
  <h3>Access Controls</h3>
</div>
<div>
  Tilmeld filters all calls to Nymph to allow users to only see and modify the entities they have access to.
</div>

  <h3>Users</h3>
</div>
<div>
  User accounts can be created either in this setup app or by using the TilmeldLogin component to register. The first user account registered in Tilmeld will be granted admin priveleges.
</div>
<div class="page-header">
  <h3>Primary Groups</h3>
</div>
<div>
  Users can have only one primary group. It becomes the group of any entities they create. By default, Tilmeld will create a new primary group for every user.
</div>
<div class="page-header">
  <h3>Secondary Groups</h3>
</div>
<div>
  Secondary groups are used to grant users additional abilities or give access to entities.
